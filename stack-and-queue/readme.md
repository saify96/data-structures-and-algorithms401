# Stacks and Queues
- A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack.
- The queue is a linear data structure used to represent a linear list. It allows insertion of an element to be done at one end and deletion of an element to be performed at the other end.
## Challenge
Write a code of Implementation of Stacks and Queues.
## Approach & Efficiency
Time = BigO(1)
Space = BigO(n)
