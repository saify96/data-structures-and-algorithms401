# Graphs
- Graph in the data structure can be termed as a data structure consisting of data that is stored among many groups of edges(paths) and vertices (nodes), which are interconnected.

## Challenge
- Implement the Graph implementation and represent it as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
  - add node
  - add edge
  - get nodes
  - get neighbors
  - size
## Approach & Efficiency
- addnode
  - Space O(n)
  - Time O(1)
- add edge
  - Space O(1)
  - Time O(1)
- get nodes
  - Space O(n)
  - Time O(1)
- get neighbors
  - Space O(1)
  - Time O(1)
- size
  - Space O(1)
  - Time O(1)
